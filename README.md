# ğŸ§© Three.js Stencil Outline Selection Scene

This project demonstrates a 3D interactive scene built with **React + Three.js** where users can **click on objects** (cubes, spheres, etc.), and an **outline is rendered using the stencil buffer technique** â€” not just a color change.

## ğŸ”§ Features

- Five different 3D objects placed in a row
- Real-time interaction via mouse click
- Only **one object** can be highlighted at a time
- Outline uses **stencil buffer masking** for a clean glow effect
- OrbitControls to navigate the 3D scene
- Clean code separation for the stencil outline logic
